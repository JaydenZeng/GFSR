''|||~michael bauer after reading a magazine article : `` bay area 's young rising chefs '' , i found out about chef ravi kapur and prospect , coined as one of 2010 's most anticipated openings .|||prospect is the little sister of boulevard .|||i have not been to boulevard , so i have no basis for comparison at this point .|||however , i read that chef ravi kapur 's menu at prospect has a more inventive and modern take as compared to his alta mare , boulevard which drew me in .|||initially , my friend and i were going to have our joint birthday dinner at prospect on 9/8/10 , but one week prior to the date , she found out they were closed due to flooding .|||i had made reservations 2 weeks prior , but no one at prospect bothered to call me to alert me of the flooding .|||thank goodness she found out through a third party , otherwise , we would have been screwed when our party arrived there .|||despite this blunder , we still wanted to try prospect .|||on monday , 9/20/10 , my friend and i arrived promptly for our 8 pm reservations and were immediately seated .|||food : do note that the portion sizes at prospect are small , so it 's recommended to get an app , entr\u00e9e , and dessert ( or 2 apps ) which will set you back about $ 60/person w/o alcohol .|||*seared octopus & calamari w/ black rice , mussels , and saffron broth ( $ 14 ) : ok .|||the octopus was perfectly grilled and tender w/ a nice bite .|||albeit salty , the fragrant saffron broth was rich and savory w/ a hint of honey .|||however , b/c the octopus laid on top of the broth , some parts of the octopus did n't soak up the broth which resulted in the edges being tough and rubbery .|||*garlic roasted quail w/ roasted almonds and tabouleh ( $ 16 ) : delish !|||the quail was perfectly roasted producing a tender and moist center w/ a light crisp skin .|||the quail was a full of flavor w/ prominent garlic flavor that was n't too overwhelming .|||the tabouleh and almonds added a nice texture contrast to the quail , as well as , a layer of nuttyness .|||the citrus tang from the preserved lemon brightened up the dish and brought all the ingredients together with the exception of the mission figs .|||the figs were too large and the sweetness overpowered the quail .|||using golden raisins would have probably been a better choice .|||*waygu zabuton w/ creamed chippolinis , smoked trumpets , and spinach ( $ 29 ) : omg , omg , and omg !|||ever since being spoiled by the waygu at wolfgang puck 's cut in vegas , no cut of meat has ever compared .|||however , what made this dish stand out was the complexity of flavors .|||the waygu was perfectly cooked to a medium rare .|||the rich marbling gave way to a soft , tender and flavor cut of meat .|||the creamed chippolinis was heavenly and added a decadent layer of savory and sweet richness to the waygu .|||the smoked trumpets were tender and the smokiness was prominent w/o being too harsh .|||the richness of the dish was offset by the slightly bitter spinach and tang from the mustard seed au jus .|||one minor complaint , however , was the dish was too heavily salted for my taste .|||*pink pearl apple tart ( $ 9 ) : meh !|||i 'm very keen on various flavor , texture and temperatures combos .|||however , the ingredients in this dessert were not cohesive .|||puff pastry was topped w/ vanilla applesauce and half a pouched apple .|||as i tried to cut into the apple , the delicate puff pastry smashed and crumbled into pieces .|||apple granita was topped w/ rich and creamy spiced ice cream .|||all of the apple components were excessively tart and there was no sweetness to offset that tartness .|||service : the staff is professional and friendly , however , a bit contrived .|||we were starving and it took over 15 minutes to order our food ( we already knew what we wanted w/ in 2 minutes of sitting down ) .|||the apps came out w/in 10 minutes of ordering , but our entrees did n't come until 25-30 minutes after our apps were taken away .|||so , there were some timing issues , but nonetheless , our waitress made sure everything was ok and the wait staff made sure our water glasses were filled .|||ambiance/d\u00e9cor : although prospect is minimalist in d\u00e9cor , it is beautifully designed .|||the large open space is warmed up by earth toned color walls and rustic wood floors and jazzed up w/ colorful modern art .|||there 's a large bar area w/ a communal table that leads to the main dining room .|||a ramp leads you to a private dining area in the back .|||if you want to impress a date , prospect is a perfect place to take him/her .|||tables are well-spaced out to allow intimacy and some distance from other patrons .|||and , even though it 's bustling , the noise level is tolerant enough to maintain a convo w/o having to loudly raise your voice .|||although i ca n't quite agree w/ michael bauer 's statement about prospect winning the triple crown , prospect does excel
