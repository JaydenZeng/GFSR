a steakhouse - as few remain from the old guard : luger 's , keen 's , delmonico 's , gallagher 's , wolfgang 's .|||speaking of wolfgang 's , rocco actually began his foray into the hospitality biz there , where he connected with current partners pete pjetrovic ( general manager ) and jeff kolenovic ( beverage director ) .|||even executive chef johnny jevric has a wolfgang 's pedigree : johnny actually has more than 20 years of experience at nyc restaurants , but for the past 10 he was the executive chef at wolfgang 's .|||clearly these guys know what they 're up to when it comes to steakhouses .|||they even made sure to staff rocco steakhouse with employees that had no less than 10 years of experience at top nyc steakhouses , like henry doda ( head waiter and sommelier ) , who also worked at wolfgang 's under the same title for 10 years .|||that 's awesome !|||okay so let me get on to the food now .|||flavor : 8 my wife and i shared a 34oz tomahawk rib eye .|||this was an absolutely gorgeous cut of meat .|||this fucker was cooked to a perfect medium rare .|||nice and pink .|||it came to us after it had cooked and rested a bit , and there was absolutely no bleed-out on the bottom of the plate .|||the temperature was a bit colder than i usually like , but i 'd rather have a well-rested and `` not hot '' steak than a hot steak that is still releasing its juices after being cut/while its being eaten .|||the majority of the chop was the eye portion .|||there was very little fat cap , which was unfortunate ( that tender and flavorful fatty ridge that encircles many cuts of rib eye ) .|||and as you can see below , there was a slight bit more sear on one side than the other ( the grey edge on the right is thicker than the left ) , but it did n't change anything in terms of the flavor quality .|||the meat was juicy , sweet , savory , funky and delicious !|||the only downside was that it was slightly under seasoned , but i chalk a lot of that up to the fact that this was such a thick steak .|||the edges had great flavor and seasoning in the crust .|||it just did n't get too deep into the center of the meat .|||another thing worth pointing out here was that the steak tasted really great when smeared with some creamed spinach and/or some of the house steak sauce .|||each item added the seasoning into the steak that i was craving .|||the steak sauce was n't as big of a hit with my wife and i on its own .|||however it certainly made sense with the steak , which is odd for me because i typically do n't like steak sauce on my steak , near my steak , or even in the same fucking room as my steak .|||it was a tomato and horseradish based sauce that was similar to a cocktail sauce but with a bit more balls from the molasses and sweeter elements .|||choice of cuts & quality available : 9 everything here is usda prime , and dry-aged on site in the restaurant 's aging box .|||they 've got all four of the main cuts here , but with some nice flourishes to them : porterhouse ( for two or more ) , two varieties of rib eye ( regular and a 34oz tomahawk chop ) , ny strip/sirloin and two cuts of filet ( one with a bone and one without ) .|||portion size & plating : 8 portions here are on par with all major nyc steakhouses .|||plating is basic and elegant : no over-the-top unnecessary garnishes , no insanely elegant art pieces .|||the plating allows you to get right down to business and i like that .|||price : 8 since this was a press dinner , i did n't have to pay .|||the prices seem to be fair and on par with most steakhouses , averaging about $ 50 per chop .|||i thought the bone-in filet was a bit pricey when i noticed it at close to $ 60 , but that item is likely significantly larger than a typical filet mignon cut .|||also worth mentioning here : del frisco 's offers a 32oz wagyu tomahawk for the same price as the 34oz tomahawk offered here .|||so for $ 95 you can get that wagyu tomahawk , which i consider to be one of the best steaks i 've ever eaten , while just losing two meager ounces in trade off .|||something to consider .|||bar : 9 the bar is a nice u-shaped set-up , and it is situated beside large floor-to-ceiling windows that overlook madison avenue .|||there 's also a nice stone accent wall that gives the room a classic vibe .|||this is definitely a good place to hang out , as both the bar and restaurant were well-attended on a tuesday after work .|||the cocktail list is distinctively classic american , which i love .|||the martini was good too , mixed up nice and cold .|||review cut for length .", "UserId": "lJUfh096CKqD06XOimcvAA", "City": "New York", "Photos": [{"Caption": "hoto of Rocco Steakhouse -
